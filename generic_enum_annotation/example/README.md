# Generic Enum Annotation

## Update
This package is discontinued. As of [`generic_enum 0.2.2`][generic_enum],  the package [`generic_enum_annotation`][generic_enum_annotation]
is no longer required as a dependency when defining or building a generic enum.

## Examples

The package [`generic_enum_example`][generic_enum_example] provides a complete example on how to define and build
generic enumeration classes. As a starting point users could clone this repository, add
their own generic enum classes to the folder `lib` and build the library.
